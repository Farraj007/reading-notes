# Learning Journal: Class 01

In our first class we learned about the basics of python such as naming declaring a variables,how to wrtie functions and call them, using strings with variables in different ways. These was a revision for our SoloLearn Prep task . 

Furthermore, i learned alot when we set up the enviroment for our python project in the terminal. Also, a new idea of importing functions from another page to our project and how to excute them as we want to use them in another page.
