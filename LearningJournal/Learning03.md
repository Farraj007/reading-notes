# Learning Journal: Class 03

 In class 03 , we made a quick review on the test writing and got some great tips from our teacher.

 Then we learned about opening files using python writting/reading , we car read and write either normally or in binary mode. In the meanwhile we used the if except else to cover any error might occur in our code . and finally "will excute either the code worked or didn't".

 We applied them both in our code demo, i learned in the class to make a new file using I/O when w made a new file in the exception .
