Today we learned about classes and object , how to arrange them and inheriht instances to lowerclasses from their parent and some time from SuperClass .

i learned more form the staticmethod ,abstract and __str__ , __repr__ . but i need to do more research and studying on these cause they are new for me . 

Last but least i learned how to enter a list of data as entry for the test .
