# Learning Journal: Class 04

1-What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
Some note and tips from the teacher during the lecture.

2-What did I learn today?
it was very enjoybale lecture because it was somehow missleading the topic itself for me. because it's the first time i heard about the linked list . but i learned alot about it and how to constructe it and some how do some manipulation . would love to learn more about it and make the best out of it.

3-What should I do differently next time?

be more focused and try to ask if i ddin;t get anything .. but sometime i don;t waste my collegues time and teachers so i do some researches on my own .


4-What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

a reaaly good question cause it was a very sensetive topic for noobies like me so i would love to learn more about how to iterate through trhe linked list and do ome manipulation .
