# Learning Journal: Class 10

1-What went well, that I might forget if I donâ€™t write down?
I belive that if i do the labs and code challenges and save it to the local machine this is writting down what i learned cause once i read the code i will recap everything .

2-What did I learn today?

Today i learned about a total new data structer which is the stack and the quee it was fun taking them after the linked list and more easy once i got used to the linked list .

3-What should I do differently next time?

For now nothing, maybe work more alone and study alone,but i belive in the course and i'm going in the flow .

4-What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Decorators actually i'm not fully aware how to use them on my own.. i try different ways tilli call them or use them from inheritance or importation so i should work more on that part
