### What is Linear Regression  
* [Link to Article](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/)  

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. The overall idea of regression is to examine two things:  
1. Does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome(dependent) variable?  
2. Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they-indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates-impact the outcome variable?  

Types of linear Regression  
- Simple Linear regression  
    - 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 1 independent variable(interval or ratio or dichotomous)  
- Mutiple linear regression  
    - 1 dependent variable (interval or ratio), 2+ independent variables (interval or ratio or dichotomous)  
- Logistic regression  
    - 1 dependent variable (dichotomous), 2+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)  
- Ordinal regression  
    - 1 dependent variable (ordinal), 1+ independent variable (nominal or dichotomous)  
- Multinomial regression  
    - 1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio or dichotomous)  
- Discriminant analysis  
    - 1 dependent variable (nominal), 1+ independent variable(s) (interval or ratio)  
    
### How to Run Linear Regression in Python  
* [Link to Article](https://bigdata-madesimple.com/how-to-run-linear-regression-in-python-scikit-learn/)  
There are several ways to implement linear regression within python. Using the following: NumPy, SciPy, Stats model and ScKit.  

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.
