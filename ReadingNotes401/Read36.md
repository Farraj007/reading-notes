### Whiteboard Advice  

First this first is, COMMUNICATE!  
Before diving into the problem of a whiteboard question do the follow:  
- Restate the question  
    - To ensure clarity and understanding of the task  
- Ask about edge cases  
    - Think about inputs and expected outputs  
- Ask about test cases  
    - This can be a free bee question, they might not have any wanted tests but shows that you know about testing.  
- Write Pseudocode and Ask if it makes Sense  
    - This is pseudocode to guide you through your algorithm  
    - This should and can be used as a checklist while writing your code  
    - Make sure the code makes sense to your interviewer  
- Write the actual code and ask if it looks good  
    - Now just convert your pseudo code into actual code in the appropriate language  
    - If you forget how, you can ask without to much grief, or ask to google, or just leave it as pseudo code for now.  
- Stuck? Ask for help !  
    - If you ever get stuck on the problem, just ask, and make sure your question is focused. For example, “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”  


### 6 Tips  
* [Link to Article](https://blog.usejournal.com/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6)  
Software interviews are HARD. Here are some ways to make them easier...   
1. Take a few minutes: 
    - Listen to the question at hand.  
    - Ask questions to clarify the question.  
    - Then ask to take a few minutes to solve this problem or come up with a plan.  
    - Thinking and speaking at the same time is hard and more than likely up badly.  
2. Write down the steps of the solution:  
    - This is actually writing down of the problem domain.  
    - Ensure all inputs/outputs are clear and the question is clear.  
3. Pseudo code first:  
    - Make a dry run first, this will let you see the code visually in your head and see many bugs that might be in your code idea.  
4. Don't sweat the small stuff:  
    - If you can't remember small functions built in or what not, its ok. You are not expected to memorize the language.  
    - Its often acceptable to say you'd look it up.  
    - Half of being a programmer is knowning how to google stuff and interpret search results.  
5. Sit down. Be humble:  
    - The interview covers more than just coding here are a few things they look at as well:  
        - Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?  
        - Do you treat the interviewer with respect?  
        - How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?  
        - Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?  
        - Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?  
        - Are you honest (especially about yourself)?  
6. Come Prepared:  
    - Interview prep bible: Cracking the Coding Interview, by Gail Laakman McDowell  
7. Review you work:  
    - If you have extra time completing an assigned task, take this time to thoroughtly review the work you have done.  
    - Check your algorithmic efficiency  
    - Check for correctness
